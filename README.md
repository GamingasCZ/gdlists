# Geometry Dash Level Lists

Hi, I wanted to be really hip and cool, so I'm rewriting the frontend of GD Lists with *hyper-modern technologies*!!

## The hyper-modern stuff
- Vue.js
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Vite

# About
GD Lists is a website where you can make and easily share your lists of **Geometry Dash** levels!
- **Check it out [here](https://gamingas.wz.cz/lofttop10/)**

## Also check out the original repo, if you feel like puking! (also contains the backend!!)
#### [The lof-top10 repository](https://github.com/GamingasCZ/lof-top10)

# Screenshots

# Todo - [issue #1](https://github.com/GamingasCZ/gdlists-vue-frontend/issues/1)
